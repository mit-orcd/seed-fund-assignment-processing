Here are the propmts used to generate this code through cursor.com

Initial prompt:
  
    can you write a python program that takes in two lists. list a is a list of names. list b is a list of document ids.
    list a will be in a text file a.txt with one name on each line.
    list b will be in a text file b.txt with one id on each line.
    the program should then randomly assign each b entry to two of the a entries.
    the program should write a list that has each name a followed by the subset of b that was assigned to that name

Second prompt:
  
    can you write a test with 8 names and 41 document ids. the names should only be one word each.

Third propmt:
  
    that is great but it should assign all documents, not just two to each person. each document should be assigned twice and only twice and to different names . can you update the program.

Fourth propmt:
  
    can you type out the code so i can copy it an test it

Fifth prompt:
  
    I tried the program but got the error "ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list"

Sixth propmt:
  
    i did a test with 41 document ids and 8 names. the b00 id got assigned to four names while some ids only got assigned to one name. each document id sould be assigned to two different names and only two names.

Seventh propmt:
  
    can you randomly shuffle the doc_ids array after b.txt has been read in and before calling the assign_documents function

Eigth propmt:
  
    Can you add a function at the end that writes a separate output file holding an alphabetically sorted list of each document id and, alongside, the two names that have been assigned that document.
